# gordonstein.dev

Personal website of Gordon Stein, PhD - software developer, researcher, and educator.

## Technologies Used

This website is built using the following technologies:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - My chosen frontend framework for web development.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - The easiest way to host a website directly from a GitHub repository.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) - Allows for automated workflows, in this case, to build and deploy the site when changes are pushed to the repository.
